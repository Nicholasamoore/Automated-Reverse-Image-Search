Automated Reverse Image Search
===============================

Reddit.com bot

This is a project that uses Selenium and the Reddit API to automate a reverse image search on Google. 'combined_google_v2.py' is the most recent program.

For example:

* An image is posted to Reddit.com (current /r/oldschoolcool)
* A redditor can reply with "!hiresbot" to call the bot
* The code goes to work and automatically does a reverse image search on the source image
* If a larger image is found, the bot automatically replies with the URL and dimensions
* Otherwise, an error message is written inside the reply
